## About This Repository

This is **[RainLib/OfficeCli-rust](https://github.com/RainLib/OfficeCli-rust)** — a **Rust rewrite** of [OfficeCLI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI), the open-source Office automation CLI originally built in C#/.NET by [iOfficeAI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI).

| | **This repo (Rust)** | **[Upstream (C#)](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI)** |
|---|---|---|
| Repository | [RainLib/OfficeCli-rust](https://github.com/RainLib/OfficeCli-rust) | [iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI) |
| Language | Pure Rust | C# / .NET (self-contained binary) |
| Version | v0.1.x (command parity) | v1.0.x (mature, 6k+ stars) |
| Runtime | None — native binary | .NET embedded in binary |
| PDF support | ✅ read / modify / preview | Via plugins |
| Goal | Lightweight, auditable, embeddable Rust core | Full-featured production CLI + ecosystem |

The Rust edition shares the same **CLI philosophy** — path-based DOM operations, JSON output, TextOffsetMap, three-layer architecture, MCP server, and live HTML preview — and has reached **command-level parity** with the C# upstream. Use upstream for maximum ecosystem integration (AionUi, plugins marketplace); use this repo when you need a **dependency-free Rust binary** or want to contribute to the Rust implementation.

## New: HCD — Chunked, Editable HTML Document Layer

HCD makes **HTML the canonical editable body** across document formats. Instead of building one
full-document DOM, `officecli hdoc import` streams a source file into bounded, content-addressed
HTML chunks, source maps, assets, and immutable revisions. This lets a frontend load only the
visible pages while backend changes still target stable `nodeId` values.

![OfficeCLI HCD workflow](docs/assets/hcd/hcd-workflow.svg)

### What the new workflow provides

- **One editing model:** DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, HTML, Markdown, and TXT become canonical HTML
  fragments with format-specific profiles.
- **Stable addressing:** editable text and mapped images have deterministic `nodeId` values;
  identical source bytes plus the same `documentId` produce the same IDs.
- **Incremental revisions:** `text.splice`, annotations, `image.replace`, and `image.geometry`
  append a revision instead of overwriting the previous state. Hash preconditions detect conflicts,
  and `patchId` makes retries idempotent.
- **Low-memory delivery:** chunk index pages contain at most 128 descriptors; full HTML and bounded
  windows use the same bundle, and the example viewer keeps only a small viewport cache in the DOM.
- **Verified assets:** raster images are content-addressed, hash-checked, revision-aware, and can be
  read or replaced without embedding Base64 data in every HTML fragment.
- **Pure Rust export:** a selected revision can be rebuilt as DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, Markdown, or TXT
  without LibreOffice. When the immutable original is supplied, supported text changes use a
  source-backed rewrite and preserve untouched package entries.

### Quick HCD round trip

```bash
# Import progressively; chunk_ready events may be consumed before import completes.
officecli hdoc import report.docx --output report.hcd --events ndjson

# Validate hashes, inspect a bounded text page, and render only chunks 20–29.
officecli hdoc validate report.hcd --json
officecli hdoc extract-text report.hcd --limit 100 --json
officecli hdoc render-html report.hcd --chunk-start 20 --chunk-limit 10 \
  --output report-window.html --json

# Apply nodeId-addressed edits and inspect immutable history.
officecli hdoc apply report.hcd --patch patch.json --expected-revision 0 --json
officecli hdoc list-revisions report.hcd --json

# Rebuild through the in-process Rust handler, or provide --source for supported source-backed edits.
officecli hdoc export report.hcd --revision 1 --output report-revision-1.docx --json

# Save the complete revision history as one portable file, then reopen it for editing.
officecli hdoc pack report.hcd --output report-portable.hcd --json
officecli hdoc unpack report-portable.hcd --output reopened.hcd --json
officecli hdoc validate reopened.hcd --json
```

`report.hcd` above is the editable directory; `report-portable.hcd` is a ZIP-based single file.
The archive includes the HCD/2 manifest, IR chunks, source maps, assets, and every referenced
revision. It does not include the original Office/PDF source. The core API accepts `.hcd`
uploads and offers `hcd` as a download format. Its 256 MiB HTTP download cap still applies.

![Reference editor offering a portable HCD download](docs/assets/hcd/hcd-portable-download.png)
![Reference editor reopened from an uploaded HCD file](docs/assets/hcd/hcd-portable-reopen.png)

The standalone lazy-loading frontend is in [`examples/hdoc/lazy-viewer`](examples/hdoc/lazy-viewer).
It fetches index pages and chunks independently, verifies hashes, and preserves `nodeId` across DOM
eviction and reload.

### Image nodes: replace content and geometry by `nodeId`

The following real PPTX example was imported to HCD, then one image node was replaced and resized.
The image keeps the same `nodeId`; its asset and geometry produce a new `visualHash` in revision 1.

| Revision 0 | Revision 1 after `image.replace` + `image.geometry` |
| --- | --- |
| ![HCD image node before patch](docs/assets/hcd/image-node-before.png) | ![HCD image node after patch](docs/assets/hcd/image-node-after.png) |

```bash
officecli hdoc list-images presentation.hcd --limit 20 --json
officecli hdoc get-image presentation.hcd <nodeId> --json
officecli hdoc put-asset presentation.hcd replacement.png --json
officecli hdoc apply presentation.hcd --patch image-patch.json \
  --expected-revision 0 --json
```

The reproducible patch is in
[`examples/hdoc/image-patch/patch-pictures-basic.json`](examples/hdoc/image-patch/patch-pictures-basic.json).
Generated `.hcd` bundles and preview output remain local and are intentionally excluded from Git.

### Fidelity contract

HCD reports fidelity instead of claiming that every format is pixel-identical. DOCX imports target
high-fidelity semantic flow; XLSX uses a virtualizable grid; PPTX uses slide-canvas geometry; PDF
uses fixed-layout pages. Unsupported Office/PDF structures are retained through the immutable source
when possible and listed as fidelity warnings. Source-backed image/media rewrites are currently
rejected before output rather than silently dropping the requested change; source-free pure-Rust
exports do include patched raster images. See the full contract in
[`docs/hcd-docx-v1.zh.md`](docs/hcd-docx-v1.zh.md).

## For AI Agents — Text/Offset → Path Mapping

Every supported format can emit a **TextOffsetMap** — full text plus a character-offset→path mapping. An agent reads the map, finds the text to change, gets the exact document path (e.g. `/body/p[3]/r[1]`), and calls `set` precisely. No regex guessing.

```bash
officecli extract-text report.docx --with-offsets --json
```

```json
{
  "full_text": "Hello World\nSecond paragraph",
  "spans": [
    { "start": 0, "end": 5, "path": "/body/p[1]/r[1]", "text": "Hello", "element_type": "run" },
    { "start": 6, "end": 11, "path": "/body/p[1]/r[2]", "text": "World", "element_type": "run" },
    { "start": 12, "end": 28, "path": "/body/p[2]/r[1]", "text": "Second paragraph", "element_type": "run" }
  ],
  "meta": { "format": "docx", "total_chars": 28, "total_spans": 3 }
}
```

**Agent setup** — feed the skill file to your coding agent:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainLib/OfficeCli-rust/main/SKILL.md
```

Or install the binary + skill in one step (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (macOS / Linux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainLib/OfficeCli-rust/main/install.sh | bash
# Windows (PowerShell):
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainLib/OfficeCli-rust/main/install.ps1 | iex

# 2. Create a blank PowerPoint
officecli create deck.pptx

# 3. Add a slide
officecli add deck.pptx / --type slide --prop title="Hello, World!"

# 4. Preview as HTML
officecli view deck.pptx --mode html

# 5. Live preview — auto-refresh on every edit
officecli watch deck.pptx
```

In another terminal, every `add` / `set` / `remove` refreshes the browser at `http://localhost:26315`.

## Why OfficeCLI?

What used to take 50 lines of Python and three separate libraries:

```python
from pptx import Presentation
prs = Presentation()
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[0])
slide.shapes.title.text = "Q4 Report"
# ... dozens more lines ...
prs.save("deck.pptx")
```

Becomes one command:

```bash
officecli add deck.pptx / --type slide --prop title="Q4 Report"
```

**Core capabilities in this Rust build:**

- **Create** blank documents or add structured content
- **Read** text, outline, stats, and annotated views — plain text or `--json`
- **Modify** elements via path-based `set` / `add` / `remove` / `move`
- **Validate** document structure and surface issues
- **Extract** text with offset→path mapping for agent positioning
- **Render** documents to HTML/SVG for visual feedback
- **Convert** legacy `.doc` / `.xls` / `.ppt` to modern formats
- **PDF** — read, preview, replace text, delete pages
- **Batch** — run multiple operations in one open/save cycle
- **MCP** — expose all operations as AI tools over JSON-RPC

## Key Features

### Three-Layer Architecture

Start simple, go deep only when needed.

| Layer           | Purpose                                  | Commands                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1: Read**    | Semantic views of content                | `view` (text, annotated, outline, stats, issues, html, svg, screenshot, pdf, forms) |
| **L2: DOM**     | Structured element operations            | `get`, `query`, `set`, `add`, `add-part`, `remove`, `move`, `swap`  |
| **L3: Raw**     | Direct XML/XPath access — universal fallback | `raw`, `raw-set`, `validate`                                 |

```bash
# L1 — high-level views
officecli view report.docx --mode annotated
officecli view report.docx --mode forms      # list form fields (SDT)
officecli view budget.xlsx --mode stats
officecli view report.pdf --mode text
officecli view report.pdf --mode pdf        # export as PDF via headless browser

# L2 — element-level operations
officecli query report.docx paragraph
officecli add budget.xlsx / --type sheet --prop name="Q2 Report"
officecli remove report.pptx '/slide[3]'

# L3 — raw XML when L2 isn't enough
officecli raw deck.pptx 'ppt/slides/slide1.xml'
officecli raw-set report.docx document --xpath "//w:p[1]" --action append \
  --xml '<w:r><w:t>Injected</w:t></w:r>'
```

### Live Preview & Rendering

Built-in HTML/SVG rendering closes the **render → look → fix** loop without Office installed:

```bash
officecli view deck.pptx --mode html     # standalone HTML preview
officecli view deck.pptx --mode svg      # SVG output
officecli watch deck.pptx                # live server at :26315
```

### Format Conversion

Multiple engines for legacy format conversion, PDF to DOCX, and standalone semantic HTML import:

```bash
officecli convert old.doc              # .doc -> .docx (LibreOffice, default)
officecli convert old.xls -o new.xlsx  # .xls -> .xlsx
officecli convert old.ppt --engine oxide  # pure-Rust engine, no external deps
officecli convert input.pdf --engine pdf2docx  # PDF -> DOCX via Python pdf2docx
officecli convert input.html -o report.docx    # headings/paragraphs/lists/tables -> Word
officecli convert input.html -o report.xlsx    # tables/content -> worksheet cells
officecli convert input.html -o report.pptx    # sections/H1 headings -> slides
officecli convert input.html -o report.pdf     # CSS-paginated PDF (pure Rust)
```

HTML conversion is always performed in-process by OfficeCLI's Rust handlers. DOCX/XLSX/PPTX
targets report `engine=rust-html-semantic` with `fidelity=semantic`; PDF reports
`engine=rust-html-css-pdf` with `fidelity=high` and uses a pure-Rust HTML/CSS cascade, layout,
pagination, font-subsetting, table and link renderer. It never invokes LibreOffice, WPS,
`pdf2docx`, Chromium, or another browser renderer, even when one of those engines is supplied on
the command line. It does not require an original Office file. JavaScript and active content remain
disabled and unsupported browser-only CSS is reported rather than executed. Arbitrary local and remote
URLs are not fetched; only validated content-addressed HCD assets are authorized. Source-free HCD export can embed validated,
content-addressed raster assets natively in DOCX/XLSX/PPTX and as PNG/JPEG PDF image XObjects;
bounded source dimensions are retained and direct PPTX picture coordinates are reused when present.
Cropping, wrapping and page collision still remain semantic rather than source-layout exact. Input
is bounded to 64 MiB and each semantic text block to 2 MiB.

HTML/HCD tables are emitted as native Word/Excel structures and editable DrawingML tables in PPTX.
PPTX tables wider than 12 columns or taller than 18 rows are split into bounded table slides with
the first row repeated. Logical PPTX tables split across HCD chunks are validated and reassembled by
stable table ID and contiguous row ranges before this layout step; PDF currently keeps the table as
a bounded native vector grid with extractable cell text and automatic page splitting.

For incremental editing, `officecli hdoc import` accepts `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`,
`.html`/`.htm`, UTF-8 `.md`/`.markdown`, and UTF-8 `.txt`. It emits immutable canonical HTML chunks and source maps;
HTML headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables remain safe canonical structures, while each editable
text span retains its exact UTF-8 source byte range. Large HTML tables use stable IDs and contiguous
128-row fragments for frontend virtualization and source-free native Office table reconstruction.
When `--document-id` is omitted, an immutable source SHA-256-derived ID makes byte-identical imports
repeat the same document and node IDs; production systems should pass their persistent business ID
to preserve lineage when source bytes change. `hdoc get-node <bundle> <nodeId>` resolves one current
node through chunk bloom filters and source maps without building a full-text buffer. `hdoc apply`
then appends nodeId-addressed text/annotation revisions. With `--source`, `hdoc export` writes the selected
revision back against the SHA-256-verified immutable source; without a source (or with a different
target), it can rebuild DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/Markdown/TXT at explicitly reported `SEMANTIC` fidelity and PDF at
canonical HTML/CSS `HIGH` fidelity through in-process Rust handlers. HTML, Markdown and TXT source-backed export rewrites only mapped text byte
ranges, preserving all other source bytes. These HCD commands are implemented entirely in Rust and
do not invoke an installed office suite. CSS PDF output preserves safe HTTP(S)/mailto links as
native URI annotations attached to the visible anchor label without appending the URL to document
text, and uses the canonical stylesheet for fenced code, tables, quotes, alerts and pagination.
PDF text can embed multiple subset fonts on one page, so emoji and uncommon symbols use a
character-level fallback instead of being replaced when an installed font covers them. Set
`OFFICECLI_HTML_PDF_FALLBACK_FONT_FILE` to provide a deterministic deployment fallback font.
`hdoc render-html --chunk-start N --chunk-limit M` materializes an independently viewable bounded
window while preserving the default full-document output when those flags are omitted.
`hdoc list-revisions`/`get-revision` expose the append-only history, and `hdoc get-asset` verifies a
content-addressed asset before reporting or copying it. The dependency-free
`examples/hdoc/lazy-viewer` progressively reads index pages, verifies chunk hashes, keeps only a
bounded viewport cache in the DOM, and preserves canonical node IDs across eviction/reload. XLSX
continues to use the Univer Canvas example for sheet/row-window virtualization and editable-cell
node mapping.
Mapped DOCX/XLSX/PPTX/PDF pictures are first-class image nodes: `hdoc list-images` and
`get-image` expose stable node IDs, asset hashes, geometry and visual preconditions. `put-asset`
stages a bounded raster without changing the current revision; `hcd-patch/3` atomically applies
`image.replace` and `image.geometry`. Patched images are preserved by source-free pure-Rust exports;
source-backed media rewrites fail before output until their format-specific rewriters are added.
The PPTX adapter materializes direct text/picture
geometry and DrawingML table grids, merges, direct cell formatting, and editable cell text while
preserving the original presentation as the source-backed export authority. Large DrawingML tables
stream as bounded row-group fragments (at most 128 rows per normal fragment); each fragment repeats
its frame geometry and column grid, and row-spanning merge groups are never split.
PDF HCD import uses a pinned pure-Rust Hayro renderer to composite each CropBox page into a
content-addressed 96-DPI PNG visual authority layer. Extractable nodeId text remains in a separate
transparent HTML interaction layer, and pages after the first are lazy-loaded. This preserves the
source page layout far better than XObject/image reconstruction, but `VISUAL` does not mean that two
different PDF engines produce byte- or pixel-identical color management and antialiasing. Edited PDF
text requires dirty-page recomposition to retain the same visual guarantee. The current lopdf/Hayro
backend also does not yet meet the 512 MiB RSS target on high-resolution JPEG2000-heavy files.

The engine table below applies to non-HTML conversion paths:

| Engine                  | Fidelity                                | Speed                  | Dependency           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `libreoffice` (default) | ~1:1                                    | Slower (process spawn) | LibreOffice (~700MB) |
| `oxide`                 | Lower (may lose styles/headers/objects) | Fast (sub-second)      | None (pure Rust)     |
| `pdf-text`              | Text only                               | Fastest                | None (pure Rust)     |
| `pdf2docx`              | Layout parser, PDF-only                 | Usually faster than LO | Python `pdf2docx` CLI |

### Resident Mode & Batch

For multi-step workflows, resident mode (Unix) keeps the document in memory. Batch runs multiple operations in one cycle.

```bash
# Resident mode — near-zero latency via Unix Domain Socket
officecli open report.docx
officecli set report.docx /body/p[1]/r[1] --prop text="Updated"
officecli save report.docx
officecli close report.docx

# Batch mode — atomic multi-command execution
echo '[{"command":"set","path":"/slide[1]/shape[1]","props":{"text":"Hello"}}]' \
  | officecli batch deck.pptx --stdin --json
officecli batch deck.pptx --commands-file batch.json --json
```

### PDF Support

```bash
officecli view report.pdf --mode text
officecli get report.pdf '/page[1]'
officecli extract-text report.pdf --with-offsets --json
officecli set report.pdf '/page[1]' --prop text="New content"
officecli remove report.pdf '/page[3]'
officecli save report.pdf
```

## AI Integration

### MCP Server

```bash
officecli mcp    # Start MCP stdio server (JSON-RPC 2.0)
```

Exposes document operations as tools — no shell access required.

### Built-in Help

```bash
officecli --help
officecli help docx paragraph
officecli help xlsx cell --json
```

When unsure about property names, use `officecli help <format> <element>` — it reflects the installed binary version.

### vs. Upstream OfficeCLI (C#)

This Rust port is **API-compatible** (same command names, path syntax, `--prop` conventions) and has reached **command-level parity** with the C# upstream. Remaining gaps are in edge-case fidelity and ecosystem tooling, not in command coverage.

| Feature | Upstream (C#) | This repo (Rust) |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Template `merge` (`{{key}}`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `view screenshot` (PNG) | ✅ | ✅ (headless Chrome/Edge/Firefox) |
| `view pdf` (PDF export) | ✅ | ✅ (headless Chromium `--print-to-pdf`) |
| `view forms` (SDT form fields) | ✅ | ✅ (docx SDT parsing) |
| `swap`, `refresh`, `plugins` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `add-part` (chart/header/footer) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `import` (CSV/TSV → xlsx) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `mark/unmark/marks/goto` (watch) | ✅ | ✅ (watch server routes) |
| `officecli install` self-setup | ✅ | ✅ (binary + skills + MCP) |
| Formula engine (150+ functions) | ✅ | ✅ (80+ functions) |
| Pivot tables (listing) | ✅ | ✅ (listing + source range) |
| Morph transitions (reporting) | ✅ | ✅ (detection + candidate count) |
| 3D models | ✅ | ✅ (HTML preview) |
| Python SDK (`officecli-sdk`) | ✅ | ✅ (Unix domain socket IPC) |
| CLI smoke & integration tests | ✅ | ✅ (39 CLI + 32 unit tests) |
